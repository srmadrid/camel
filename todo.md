# To-Do

- [ ] Add SIMD support for fixed size linear algebra operations. This will be done through extra functions with prefixes like ```cml_avx_function```, ```cml_sse_function```, ```cml_neon_function```, etc. The functions will be implemented in the ```fmatrixavx.h```, ```fmatrixsse.h```, ```fmatrixneon.```, etc. for header only versions, and ```fcmatrixavx.h/c```, ```fcmatrixsse.h/c```, ```fcmatrixneon.h/c```, etc. for compiled versions. The library will detect the platform and the available SIMD intrinsics, and only let you use the functions that are available for your platform. For example, if you are on a platform that supports AVX, you will be able to use the ```cml_avx_function``` functions, but not the ```cml_sse_function``` or ```cml_neon_function``` functions.
- [ ] Test the matrices for OpenGL and Vulkan compatibility (i.e. row major vs column major).
- [ ] Once all vector and matrix operations are implemented, add the same for doubles, i.e. ```CML_Vector2``` -> ```CML_Vector2d```, ```CML_Vector3``` -> ```CML_Vector3d```, ```CML_Vector4``` -> ```CML_Vector4d```, ```CML_Matrix2x2``` -> ```CML_Matrix2x2d```, ```CML_Matrix3x3``` -> ```CML_Matrix3x3d```, ```CML_Matrix4x4``` -> ```CML_Matrix4x4d```, etc.
- [ ] Have a look at maybe offering a fortran interface, like ```cml_f90_function``` or f99 depending on if I use a specific fortran standard or not.
- [ ] Edit matrix functions to make them access the matrix elements in a column major order, instead of row major order like they do now (thsi is because we just changed matrices to be column major instead of row major). So for example, change ```CML_Matrix2x2``` accesses from ```A.m00```, ```A.m01```, ```A.m10```, ```A.m11``` to ```A.m00```, ```A.m10```, ```A.m01```, ```A.m11``` to follow the memory layout of column major matrices.
